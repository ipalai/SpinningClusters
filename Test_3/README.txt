Real 21 contains simulations where cluster topology is maintained by bonds and angles created on the go. Kangle is very high (200) so as to resist folding. Larger Kangle are unstable (I tried 400). A bit of folding is still present.

Real 23 to 29: same as before, but with timestep reduced to 0.002 and different Kangles, up to 600. Kbond up to 300. In the last realisations, clustering on the go is introduced, every 2000 steps.

Real 31 contains simulations where clusters are made into rigid bodies on the go, more frequently (clusterever=100ts) .No bonds or angles are formed, and timesteps is again increased to 0.08.
