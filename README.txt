Test_0 was used to develop the LAMMPS script that gived spinning and to test a bit the external torque parameter.

Test_1 contains tests about the shape of clusters and some sweep of parameter spaces (patch interaction, central interaction, ranges...)
)

Test_2 contains simulations at density=0.2 or 0.1, nA~10000, RunSteps~5e7, to get some more statistics and check the fractal dimension. Dump of trajectories is both linear and logarithmic, though linear dump is not downloaded.
